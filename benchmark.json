Since its introduction by Eric Kool at the American Chemical Society annual meeting in 2000 (Rawls, 2000), synthetic biology has garnered significant investment from industry and widespread attention from academia (Garner, 2021). This interdisciplinary field integrates principles from biology, engineering, and computational science to design and construct biological systems with novel functions. In the context of bioplastic production, synthetic biology enables the precise engineering of microbial metabolism to optimize the synthesis of bioplastic monomers and polymers. Key synthetic biology techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas9 for genome editing, modular DNA assembly for pathway construction, adaptive laboratory evolution, and computational modeling for pathway and fermentation conditions optimization, have demonstrated their power in advancing microbial cell factory engineering.",
